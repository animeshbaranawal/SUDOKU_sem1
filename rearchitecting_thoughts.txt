Algorithm:
-> have a separate condition class which will check a given condition
   on a range of indices
-> condition can be of many types.. use abstraction here

GUI:
-> one main grid
-> better to first create a jigsaw ui.. 
   the standard case is the special case of jigsaw ui
   Think of a procedure to create a jigsaw tiling for a region
-> take care of abstraction

Algorithm for generating jigsaw puzzles:
-> create a hamiltonian cycle for subset of the graph
-> travelling across the cycle, exchange cells..
